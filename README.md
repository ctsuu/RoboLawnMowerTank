# RoboLawnMowerTank
Autonomous, Tank track drive, Acreage, Lawn Mower, Gas Powered. 

## Scope of Work
To build a autonomous gas powered tank track drived lawn mower that aim for the large area work, such as acreage, farm and parks. 

The lawn mower based on KB750-8A model, 130KG, cutting path 550mm wide. Moving speed 0-6km/hr. Slope 0-30 deg. Remove control range 100m. Engine output 7.5 horse power.

## Assumption: 
I haven't see the real machine yet, therefore, I made some necessary assumptions in order to complete the high lever control system design. 

1. Electrical power supply. The original lawn mower may not have enough battery power to run additional electronic sensors and devices. I consider add a battery holder for a 12V 20AH AGM SLA Battery, and charger. 
2. Controller enclosure, Power distribution, fuse, 12VDC-19VDC converter, waterproved connector as needed.
3.
